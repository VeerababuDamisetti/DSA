You are given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits.

Example: 123 is represented as [1,2,3]

You must add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ) and return the required array or list.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

Example:

If the vector has [1, 2, 3], the returned vector should be [1, 2, 4],

as 123 + 1 = 124.

Some notes:

Your returned array must not have any leading zeros. Example:
Input:
[0,0,2,1]
 
Ouput:
[2,2] // no leading zeros
Maximum size of the array is 300 so avoid converting it to a string or an integer. Instead, try to think of what happens when 1 is added to the number.
